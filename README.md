# ScheduledNotifier
A simple project using the ```plyer``` package : <a href="https://pypi.org/project/plyer/">(link)</a>, that schedules a notification by inserting a task using the Windows Scheduler.

The use cases of this small functionality can be expanded where the script is made to run according to the inputs recieved from users on a Python GUI built on KivyMD/Tkinter/PyQT.
